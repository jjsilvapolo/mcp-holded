    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated</strong>: December 11, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the MCP Holded server ("the Server", "we", "our") handles data when you use it to connect your AI assistant to the Holded Invoice API.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>

    <p>The MCP Holded server is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude) and the Holded Invoice API. This server runs locally on your machine and does not operate any cloud services or remote servers that process your data.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>

    <h3>2.1 What Data We Collect</h3>

    <p>The Server requires and processes the following data:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Holded API Key</strong>: Your personal API key from Holded, provided via the <code>HOLDED_API_KEY</code> environment variable</li>
        <li><strong>API Request Data</strong>: Data you or your AI assistant send through the Server to interact with Holded (e.g., invoice details, contact information, product data)</li>
        <li><strong>API Response Data</strong>: Data returned from the Holded API in response to your requests</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 How Data is Collected</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The API key is read from your local environment variables when the Server starts</li>
        <li>Request and response data flows through the Server during runtime as you interact with your AI assistant</li>
        <li>No data is collected, transmitted, or stored beyond the immediate request-response cycle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>

    <h3>3.1 How We Use Your Data</h3>

    <p>Your data is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>API Authentication</strong>: Your Holded API key authenticates requests to the Holded API</li>
        <li><strong>Request Proxying</strong>: The Server forwards your requests to the appropriate Holded API endpoints</li>
        <li><strong>Response Delivery</strong>: API responses are returned to your AI assistant for processing and presentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 What We Don't Do With Your Data</h3>

    <p>The Server does NOT:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Store your API key or any request/response data persistently</li>
        <li>Log API requests, responses, or your API key to disk</li>
        <li>Analyze, profile, or perform any secondary processing on your data</li>
        <li>Use your data for training, analytics, or improvement purposes</li>
        <li>Transmit your data to any servers or services operated by the maintainers of this project</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

    <h3>4.1 No Persistent Storage</h3>

    <p>The Server does not store any data persistently. All data exists only in memory during the runtime of each request and is immediately discarded after the response is delivered.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Temporary Memory Usage</h3>

    <p>During request processing:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your API key is held in memory for the lifetime of the Server process</li>
        <li>Request and response data exists in memory only for the duration of each individual API call (typically milliseconds to seconds)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third-Party Access</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Holded API</h3>

    <p>Your API key and request data are transmitted to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service</strong>: Holded Invoice API</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: To fulfill your requests for invoicing, contacts, products, and other Holded functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Endpoint</strong>: https://api.holded.com/api/invoicing/v1/</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>: <a href="https://www.holded.com/legal/privacy-policy">Holded's Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Holded API is operated by Holded and is subject to their own privacy policy and terms of service.</p>

    <h3>5.2 No Other Third Parties</h3>

    <p>Your data is NOT shared with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The maintainers or contributors of this open-source project</li>
        <li>Any analytics services</li>
        <li>Any telemetry or error reporting services</li>
        <li>Any other third-party services or APIs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 AI Assistant Provider</h3>

    <p>If you use this Server with an AI assistant (e.g., Claude Desktop), the AI assistant provider may receive data according to their own privacy practices. Please review the privacy policy of your AI assistant provider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Claude</strong>: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Transmission Security</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>All communications with the Holded API use HTTPS encryption</li>
        <li>The Server runs locally on your machine, eliminating network exposure to untrusted parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.2 Your Responsibilities</h3>

    <p>To maintain the security of your data:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Never commit your API key to version control</strong> (use environment variables only)</li>
        <li><strong>Use environment variables</strong> for sensitive configuration</li>
        <li><strong>Regularly update</strong> to the latest version for security patches</li>
        <li><strong>Review permissions</strong> granted to the MCP server in your AI assistant</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the Security Policy</strong> available at <a href="https://github.com/iamsamuelfraga/mcp-holded/blob/main/SECURITY.md">SECURITY.md</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.3 API Key Protection</h3>

    <p>Your Holded API key grants full access to your Holded account. Protect it as you would a password:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Store it securely in environment variables</li>
        <li>Never share it publicly or include it in code</li>
        <li>Revoke and regenerate it immediately if you suspect it has been compromised</li>
        <li>Manage API key access through Holded's settings at: Settings &gt; API</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Open Source Transparency</h2>

    <p>This Server is open source and available at:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Repository</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/iamsamuelfraga/mcp-holded">https://github.com/iamsamuelfraga/mcp-holded</a></li>
        <li><strong>License</strong>: MIT License</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can inspect the source code to verify:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No data storage mechanisms are implemented</li>
        <li>No logging of sensitive data occurs</li>
